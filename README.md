About this Project
==================
This is a game I created when learning how to use DirectX9 by following the book Beginning Game Programming by
Johnathan S. Harbour.  A fair portion of the art assets are not my own, they came along with the book. Also, the 
programming style used on this project was one that was used in the book which I followed. 


Compiling this Project
======================
This project uses the June 2010 release of DirectX 9. The version of Direct Sound used in this project was one modified 
by Mr. Harbour due to the various versions of DirectSound as of the time he was writing the book. Other than DirectX 9,
there aren't any other dependencies with this project.
